# DOSP_PROJ1
 Bitcoin mining

The goal of this project is to use Erlang and the actor model and implement a bitcoin mining simulator that finds the string appended with the ufid such that the hash for the string using the SHA256 hashing algorithm has k or more preceding zeroes. The objective is to create a solid, multi-core-compatible solution to this problem using Erlang and the Actor Model.

Example:
1
adobra;kjsdfk11 0d402337f95d018438aad6c7dd75ad6e9239d6060444a7a6b26299b261aa9a8b
indicates that the coin with 1 leading 0 is adobra;kjsdfk11and it is prefixed by the gatorlink ID adobra.
